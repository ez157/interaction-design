# interaction-design

This repository features some of the work I've done in my Interaction Design Overview course that has led me to become more aware of how design principles can be used to address user needs. Links to the prototypes are in the prototypes.md file.

Brief descriptions for the individual files:
- Progressive Disclosure: individual project where I created a prototype of a website for an event and tailored the website to appeal to a specific audience
- Modifying Figma: group project where we analyzed Figma as an overly complex system and added features to its interface in a simple prototype to reduce confusion for new users
